Overview: 
Recently, I have become very fond of Bungie's new game "Destiny". However, for those of us that don't use our gaming systems to socialize and have a lacking friend's list on PSN/XBL, it's somewhat of a pain to coordinate and get more people to join your 'fireteam' for mandatory multiplayer parts. Luckily, there is a website that allows users to post for groups. This is a scraper for a 'looking for group' site. This is just for xbox360 at the moment with a limited amount of selected activities, but in the future I plan to expand to support all platforms and allow for all actvities.



Technical: 
This python script is a scraper that makes use of a backend php link that queries for posts on the lfg's server. This requires mechanize and beautifulsoup as well as some other basic libraries. (see imports in top of file)
